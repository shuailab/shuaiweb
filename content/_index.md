Human brain is the most complex system known to human being. How the brain system efficiently and robustly support the neural computation and information flow is still an open question. Modern neuroimaging techniques have enabled high-throughput measurements and characterization of the function and structure of the brain. Neuroimaging has been found to be a powerful method with enormous implications on both scientific discovery and clinical applications, such as understanding how the brain structure support the cognitive functions, how to identify brain regions disrupted by neurodegenerative diseases, how the disease processes such as Alzheimerâ€™s Disease disrupt the functions, how to monitor the disease progression, and how to evaluate the treatment effect as a more sensitive and reliable index than conventional subjective cognitive measurements, etc. We are interested on the modeling and analysis of the brain systems using multi-modality neuroimaging data, focusing on system-level understanding and innovations in machine learning and statistical analysis, to create an analytic framework that can convert the high-dimensional and noisy neuroimaging data into scientific knowledge and better clinical practices.
